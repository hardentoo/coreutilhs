About coreutilhs
================

coreutilhs is a collection of Haskell versions of useful CLI-programs, such as 
the ones found in GNU coreutils and among the BASH built-ins. The idea is to 
have a set of self-contained Haskell example programs that are suitable for 
tutorials and reading material for Haskell newbies. coreutilhs give newbies a 
taste for what "real" Haskell programs might look like, and hopefully they can 
help motivate newbies.

The current goal is to implement simple self-contained version of some subset 
of GNU coreutils and the BASH built-ins. A program should do roughly the same 
as its coreutils/BASH-equivalent without any options.

There are currently no plans to implement any options, as coreutilhs should 
have very short programs that are easy to follow for newbies. In the future, 
however, options might be considered implemented for fun.

Also note that performance is not a goal right now. If performance gets in the 
way of readability, it is not considered. In the future this might change as 
well, for fun.

The programs are all self-contained little pieces that can be run with 
runhaskell, or compiled with GHC -make *.hs. 


Versioning
==========

coreutilsh follows x.y version numbering.

x means a big milestone has been reached. The current x+1 milestone is 
implementing rudimentary versions of a big chunk of interesting programs. 
There is no formalised target subset as of now.

y means a big change. This is mostly for when a program has been added, or 
substantially improved.

Minor bug fixes do not lead to releases by themselves. Severe bug fixes 
qualify as a "big change" though. And if there are a bunch of minor bug fixes 
just waiting to be released, and no proper release is on the horizon, a y+1 
bump may take place.
