About coreutilhs
================

coreutilhs is a collection of Haskell versions of some of the programs found 
in GNU coreutils, usable as examples and tutorials for Haskell newbies. 
coreutilhs give newbies a taste for what "real" Haskell programs might look 
like.

The current goal is to implement simple self-contained version of all of the 
programs in GNU coreutils. A program should do roughly the same as its 
coretuils-equivalent without any options.

There are currently no plans to implement any options, as coreutilhs should 
have very short programs that are easy to follow for newbies. In the future, 
however, completely full replacements of the coreutils programs might be 
considered implemented for fun.

Also note that performance is not a goal right now. If performance gets in the 
way of readability, it is not considered. In the future this might change as 
well, for fun.

The programs are all self-contained little pieces that can be run with 
runhaskell, or compiled with GHC -make *.hs. 


Versioning
==========

coreutilsh follows x.y version numbering.

x means a big milestone has been reached. The current x+1 milestone is 
implementing rudimentary versions of all relevant programs from GNU Coreutils. 
Which ones are indeed relevant is yet to be decided.

y means a big change. This is mostly for when a program has been added, or 
substantially improved.

Minor bug fixes do not lead to releases by themselves. Severe bug fixes 
qualify as a "big change" though. And if there are a bunch of minor bug fixes 
just waiting to be released, and no proper release is on the horizon, a y+1 
bump may take place.
